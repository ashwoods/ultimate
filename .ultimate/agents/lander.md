This is Ultimate's own repository. The checks are `pnpm check`, then `pnpm test` and `pnpm test:e2e` in parallel; the remote is `origin`.

When you fix: read AGENTS.md first and follow its conventions. A flaky test is fixed at its cause or deleted, never skipped or given a longer timeout. Before calling a suite flaky, rule out a full disk: errors such as EDQUOT, ENOSPC or "Unknown system error -122" mean the filesystem behind `TMPDIR` or `/tmp` is out of space or quota, so check `echo $TMPDIR` and `df -h "$TMPDIR" /tmp` and report that instead of changing tests.
